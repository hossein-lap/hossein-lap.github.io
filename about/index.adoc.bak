Hi I'm Hossein

Yet another minimalist person with a passion about Open Source Software.

I was a Computer guy from my early days back in my 1st and 2nd grade.
But all I did was playing video games. Until my dad came to me and said:

[qoute]
____
Don't just play video games kid, it can do much more than that. try to
learn it.
____

And that was it. It became the goal of my life :)

== Programming

I have a solid background with writing and patching softwares in some
programming languages (`C` `Lua` `Go` `Bash` `Python`) by _mostly_ using some
tools that required a little programming knowledge to modify / configure or
extend.

.Let me give you an example:
****
I wanted to learn Python language so I needed to take some notes, I decided to
use LaTeX for that matter and my notes were getting dirty, I was losing some of
them, they're getting out-of-hand, then I've decided to use git for managing
them.
****

I learned `C` by patching / configuring the https://suckless.org[suckless]
tools, `Lua` by configuring https://neovim.io[neovim] and writing plugins for it, `Bash` by using
it daily with "Live inside terminal" approach. of cource I've also read books
and documentations for them eventually. `Python` and `Go` are the ones that I
really sat-down and read books / docs about them from the beginning of the
journey.

== Workflow

A simple guy likes simplicity.

I use https://st.suckless.org[st] as my terminal emulator.
I have https://vim.org[vim] (or https://neovim.io[neovim] I'm fine with both)
as my text editor in my pocket, https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki[tmux] as
multiplexer / session-manager by my side, I have a home in any window manger
(but I perfer it to be inside https://dwm.suckless.org[dwm] over the other).
Also for some bidirectional papers and documents I've let the little evil in,
https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs[(doom) emacs].

To be honest, I just need a POSIX-complaint shell, tmux, vim and git.
All of these can be repleaced and I'm fine with their alternatives.

=== Operating System

Currently (as of June 21, 2024) I'm using NixOS as my daily-driver OS.

I enjoy NixOS's approach and its reproducability, just starting to like Nix
language / packages manager. I've wanted to learn a functional programming
language anyway (I still might go for Elixir) so, that's might be it,
who knows ;)

Update (September 14, 2024): Back to my good old
https://voidlinux.org[Void Linux] for a while now.

I'm very fine and comfortable with most of other Linux Distributions out there.
I've started using Linux with Ubuntu 18.04, shortly moved to Linux mint 18
and used it about a 6 to 10 months, after that I went for Manjaro xfce,
installed it, used it for about 3 or so months and then, I installed Manjaro i3.

The emphasizing *Manjaro i3* is because it really changed the way I look at a
GUI.
