          <p>Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight and embeddable programming language. It is
used by many frameworks, games and other applications. While it can be used
by itself, it has been designed to be easy to embed in another application.
It is implemented in ANSI C, a subset of C programming language that is very
portable, which means it can run on many systems and many devices where the most
other scripting languages would not be able to run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Lua&rdquo; (pronounced LOO-ah) means &ldquo;Moon&rdquo; in Portuguese. As such, it is neither an
acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun.
Lua comes from two languages: DEL and Sol. DEL means &ldquo;Data Entry Language&rdquo;,
While Sol means &ldquo;Simple object language&rdquo; and also means Sun in Portuguese.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of main advantages of Lua is its simplicity. Programming which is also called
scripting in the case of programs that run inside an embedded applications, is
the process of writing computer program. A programming language is a language
used to give instructions to a computer through computer code that is contained
in a computer program. A programming language consists of two things: a syntax,
which is like grammar in English, and libraries, basic functions provided with
the language. These libraries could be compared with vocabulary in English.</p>
